# FairGame Apps Newsletter
FairGame Apps is an independent design studio that makes educational apps aimed at teaching learning fundamentals to early learners. The idea was to create a weekly e-newsletter to generate interest and keep in contact with potential app users. I designed the logo and graphics using Illustrator and PhotoShop and scripted the email using HTML and CSS. The project provides subscribe and unsubscribe functionality as well as a weekly content template. 

### Here's how it turned out...
